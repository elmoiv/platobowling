## Usage
```batch
python bowling.py
```

## How to
  - Download any android emulator ([LD Player](https://encdn.ldmnq.com/download/en/LDPlayer_ens_3020_ld.exe) is good).
  - This scripts runs under `1920x1080` emulator settings in order to work properly.
  - Download [Plato](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plato.android&hl=en) from Googleplay.
  - Launch the app and select bowling game then run the bot.
  - Now your gameplay will be all automated until you terminate the script.
  
## Problems
  - Bot is not perfect, sometimes it can lose one pin.
  - This won't affect you so much as it has high win rate
  - Hadn't tested it with any other emulator. only tested on LD Player.
